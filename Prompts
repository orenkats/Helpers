1.Explain the flow in a step-by-step manner, focusing on:
 • What happens first, second, and so on.
 • The parameters passed and values returned at each step.
 • How components in different files interact and abstract details that aren’t immediately obvious.
2. Clarify the abstractions:
 • What is being abstracted?
 • How does it work behind the scenes?
 • Why is it implemented this way?
3. Provide:
 • Concrete examples (realistic code snippets).
 • Abstract views or diagrams (to simplify the flow).
 • What happens when something is called/triggered and why.
4. Highlight:
 • The role of each component in the flow.
 • How files relate to each other in the system.
 • Anything that may be hard to see but critical to the behavior.
